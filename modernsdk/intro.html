<p>
N64 development has suffered for years due to extremely old devkits. 
Both options used in homebrew are 20+ years old, and have dated compilers with only C89 support.
Using such antique tools was deemed unacceptable by myself.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, there is no standard setup for using a current toolset or OS with the SDK library.
Earlier attempts 
(such as <a href="https://github.com/trhodeos/modern-n64sdk">trhodeos's "modern-n64sdk"</a>) 
were very complicated, with annoying paths and strange toolchain setups.
</p>

<p>
So I decided to fix this situation, and make a devkit that would work on a modern Debian-based distro (as it's the only Linux I've ever messed with).

</p>

<p>
My goals are: <br>
    - Have a modern toolchain using latest GCC. <br>
    - Support most of the sample programs. <br>
    - Port over or provide replacements for specific tools like rspasm or rgb2c. <br>
    - Have documentation showing how to use specific features, such as linkerscripts. <br>
