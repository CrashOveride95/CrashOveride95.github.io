    <h3>Preface</h3>

    <p>"Linking" involves putting the different data (code, assets) that goes into your program together into a ROM.
    In the Modern SDK linking is done by passing a linkerscript to <code>ld</code>, and the output ELF file being converted to a ROM binary by <code>objcopy</code>.</p>
    
    <p>To help simplify the process, by default the script is passed through the C preprocessor <code>cpp</code>, allowing for macros and comments to be used easily.</p>
    
    <p>I won't be reinterating the entire <code>ld</code> manual here, but I'll show the stuff needed for N64 projects.</p>
    
    <h3><a href="lkscript_specific/defmacros.html">Default macros</a></h3>
    
    <p>These macros are included in all of the demos' scripts, and I highly suggest you use them as well as they simplify the script greatly. This page covers these macros and how to use them.</p>
    
    <h3><a href="lkscript_specific/commands.html">Commands</a></h3>
    
    <p>An explanation of how to link in code/data and the other commands.</p>
